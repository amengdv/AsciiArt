# ASCII Art Generator
A toy project that I created in order to understand Javascript even more.
It was a 1 week project and I'm having fun making this.

## Why this project?
I just thought it could be fun to learn image processing and how it works under
the hood. So I can have fun learning Javascript.

## How do you make it?
I just googled a lot of things to Wiki, some article, some common website to learn
Javascript syntax. I did use ChatGPT but the solution that it gave is unnecessarily
complex. So most of the problem I solved myself except the function called grayscaleToAscii.

## WHY DID YOU USE CHATGPT YOU'RE LEARNING!!
I KNOW I KNOW. BUTT!!! My excuses is that I had no idea that you could use normalization.
Honestly I googled, try my own solution and it still just lack of detail and everything.
So I know what I need to improve as well as hey I understand that function I don't just copy paste it blindly.
Go easy on me. Welp at least for now. I'm still working on my problem solving soft skills especially the one 
that lean towards math. Ill work harder. BUT THAT'S IT. ONE FUNCTION!!! THE REST IS ME FIGURING STUFF OUT.
